#  4. Soil erosion detection

Here is one of the open problems in Quantum. Soil erosion is a really unwanted process that spoils huge areas of fertile land. 
Your task is to train model for erosion detection.

***What do you have***
* Sentinel2 tile (T36UXV_20200406T083559_TCI_10m.jp2)
* Masks with soil erosion for this tile (masks directory)

***What should we get***
* jupyter notebook with data analysis
* script for model training (preferably tf.keras)
* readme file
* requirements.txt file
* solution report
